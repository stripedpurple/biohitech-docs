= Troubleshooting BioBrain Networking Issues

____
*_NOTE:_* All biobrains take upto 2 minutes to boot without internet.
____

== First Steps

. Determine if the biobrain is a Gen1, Gen2, Or Gen3 biobrain
+
____
*_Note:_* Gen1 biobrains are dark (blackish/dark brown) and small. Gen2 are larger with silver sides and a black top/bottom. Gen3 units are silver with an orange wrapping.
____

. If the biobrain is a Gen 1or 2 a dongle (usb to ethernet) is required for booting. If the dongle is missing, it will take a minimium of 2 minutes to boot.
. Once the unit has completed booting you will need to login. The username is `bht` and rthe password is `edwinhoch!!!`
+
____
*_NOTE:_* While typing in the password field there will be no visible changes
____

== Confirming DHCP

. Run the following command to determine the current state of the network interfaces
+
[source,shell]

The inet (IP Address) should be valid for the connected network.

. If the IP Address is not valid for the the connected network, it is most likely statically configured. You can validate with or not the device is statically configured by check one of two files
 .. On Ubnunto 18+ networking is configured via netplan. This can be confirmed by looking at `/etc/netplan/99-bht-internet.yaml`.
+
[source,bash]
----
cat /etc/netplan/99-bht-internet.yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eno1:
      addresses: []
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp6: true
      nameservers:
        addresses:
        - 8.8.8.8
        - 8.8.4.4
----
+
If the addresses array is empty (i.e. `addresses:[]`) the interface is configured as DHCP. Additionally the `dhcp4: true` and `dhcp4: true` will be set. If the address array has an IP assigned (i.e. `addresses: ['10.1.0.130']`) the interface is configured statically.

 .. On Ubuntu \<= 16 networking is configured in `/etc/network/intefaces`
+
[source,bash]
----
cat /etc/network/interfaces

# DHCP Configuration
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

# Static Configuration
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.1.5
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.254
----
. To reconfigure the interface for DHCP run the following script
+
[source,shell]
----
cd /opt/bht/biobrain/bin
./net-config.sh -d <interface> # <interface> should be replaced with the interface used for internet i.e. eth0 or p2p1
----

. That should be it! ðŸ˜ƒ

== Bringing up down interfaces

. If the networking interface is missing from the `ifconfig` results it might be down. Re-run ifconfig but with the addition of the all flag (i.e. `ifconfig -a`)
. Check if the interface now appears in the list. if so you are clear to move to the next step, else new configuration will need to be written for the interface. However, writing new configuration is beyond the scope of this guide.
. Run `sudo ifup <interface>` where `<interface>` is replaced with the interface used for internet.
. That should be it! ðŸ˜ƒ

== Recovering from a Readonly filesystem

Sometimes the OS (Operating System) will exzpierence a issue that might cause damage to the filesystem. To protect the filesystem the OS might mount the filesystem as Readonly.

. The first step is to try rebooting the biobrain. However if it has been returned to BioHiTech it is most likely the reboot has already been tried and did not work. If a reboot does not work move to the next step.
. To view all of the mount points available in the system run in a terminal:
+
[source,shell]
----
mount | grep /dev/sd
----

. In this case, the root file system is the mount point. But you have, for example, have a problem with creating a file in your home folder, you're going to have to remount /home. Look carefully. When the mount point is selected, left it to mount with write access:
+
[source,shell]
----
sudo mount-o remount,rw /
# Or to /home:
sudo mount-o remount,rw /home
----

. After that you will be able to create the file without any problems. After completion of the work, in order to avoid data corruption when you restart, it is desirable to remount the file system back to read-only mode:
+
[source,shell]
----
sudo mount-o remount,ro /
----

. That should be it! ðŸ˜ƒ

== When all else fails, REINSTALL

. Reinstall the OS the normal way
. CelebrateðŸŽ‰
